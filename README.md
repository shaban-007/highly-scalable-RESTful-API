# Owais Capital RESTful API

## Overview

Welcome to the Owais Capital RESTful API repository. This API is designed to manage financial data for Owais Capital. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a MySQL database. This README file will guide you through setting up and running the API, deployment options, and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Database Server
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (optional, for Kubernetes deployment)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/owais-capital-api.git
   cd owais-capital-api

## Configure the database connection by editing config.js:


   // config.js
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  database: 'owaiscapitaldb',
};

module.exports = dbConfig;


## Initialize the database schema:

npm run db:migrate

## npm run db:migrate
